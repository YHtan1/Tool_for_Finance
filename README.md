# yahoo_scraper
This repo contains code to scrape data from Yahoo Finance to perform financial data analysis

I wrote this script in my spare time while interning so my code is likely to have a lot of bugs.

I was also unable to find a workaround for dates before 1/1/1970, so anyone that has an idea for that issue can contribute to improve the code.
