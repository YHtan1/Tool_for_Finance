# 1.Price_history_S&P500_working.py
This file contains code to scrape data from Yahoo Finance to perform financial data analysis
I wrote this script in my spare time while interning so my code is likely to have a lot of bugs.
I was also unable to find a workaround for dates before 1/1/1970, so anyone that has an idea for that issue can contribute to improve the code.

While studying PCA, I could not find a webpage to convert html to pdf, so I wrote this program to print webpages to pdf format.
